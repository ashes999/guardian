RPG Maker is a versatile platform for all kinds of games, not just RPGs.

This repository contains many of my experiments. They're raw (usually just proof-of-concept).

TODO: describe each idea and link the repository.

# Future Ideas

- A trap-style game where you have to stop some horde of enemies. Lay traps strategically around the invasion area, work with locals to team up and get more stuff done. Survival or failure depends on how well you apply traps and teamwork.
