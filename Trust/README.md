# Trust

**Plot and Synopsis:** You're the son of an army commander. There's a traitor in the army, which you discovered; but your dad doesn't believe you. Your goal is to flush out the army traitor, and report it to your father, to earn his trust.

**Details:** Initially, your father doesn't trust you, and the right-hand man does appear to believe you. At the end of the game, when you capture the traitor, you have to pick: do you turn him over to your dad, or to the right-hand man?

It turns out that your dad believes you (even though he's skeptical initially), and the right-hand man doesn't; in the latter, the army gets ambushed and killed, and in the former, the attack is fended off.

For the sequel, *the right-hand man is also a traitor,* and you have to discover it and take him down.
