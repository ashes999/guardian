# Danger Quest Knights

A collaborative effort with kids aged 10, 7, 5, and 5 to create a game. By kids, for kids.

This is a slow-boiled project. If you want recent status and details, please see the wiki. If you want to try it, clone the repo and double-click on `Game.exe`. (You will need the VX Ace RTP for now, which you can get [here](http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/download/additional/run-time-packages).)
